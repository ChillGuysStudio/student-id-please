# Student ID, please

Student ID, please is a game about moderating a university Discord server. Junior Moderators inspect assigned university records and share findings in chat. The Moderator compares those findings with an applicant's claims and credentials, then accepts, rejects, flags, or bans the applicant.

The Common Project Repository, or CPR, contains the shared design, integration contracts, deployment, and service release pointers. Service implementations live in private repositories. Their container images are public.

## Architecture

Eight domain services own separate data. They communicate through REST, RabbitMQ events, and WebSocket chat. The gateway routes client requests and does not own game data.

[Architecture](docs/architecture.md) explains ownership and technology choices. [Game flows](docs/flows.md) describe a shift. [Integration principles](docs/integration.md) explain mocked and integrated deployments.

## Team and services

| Developer | Owned services | Stack | Source profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chicu Andrei | Moderation, Discord DMs | Python, FastAPI | `andrei` |
| Vremere Adrian | Applicant, Credential | Java, Spring Boot | `adrian` |
| Alexei Maxim | Server Rules, University Record | Java, Spring Boot | `alexei` |
| Cebotari Alexandru | Player, Session | Python, FastAPI | `alexandru` |

[Service references](docs/services/README.md) list public images and integration settings. The [submodule configuration](.gitmodules) lists private source repositories. The gateway is shared infrastructure, separate from each developer's two domain services.

## Start work

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for CPR rules. Follow [the development guide](docs/development.md) to run public images, install hooks, or check out only your two services. The default setup does not fetch private source.
